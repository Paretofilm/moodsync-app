# Backend Deployment Required

## Current Status
✅ CI/CD Pipeline is configured and working
✅ GitHub Actions has AWS credentials
✅ Amplify app exists (ID: d32q73w0m2w4bq)
❌ Backend CloudFormation stack doesn't exist
❌ Amplify builds fail with "Stack does not exist"

## Required Action

You need to deploy the backend before the app can build in Amplify:

### Option 1: Deploy Backend Locally (Recommended)

```bash
cd /Users/kjetilge/mcp-servers/moodsync-app
npx ampx sandbox --app-id d32q73w0m2w4bq --branch main
```

This will:
1. Create the CloudFormation stack (amplify-d32q73w0m2w4bq-main-branch-c8c420b81a)
2. Deploy all backend resources (Auth, Data, Storage)
3. Take about 5-10 minutes

### Option 2: Use Pipeline Deploy

```bash
cd /Users/kjetilge/mcp-servers/moodsync-app
npx ampx pipeline-deploy --app-id d32q73w0m2w4bq --branch main
```

## After Backend Deployment

Once the backend is deployed:

1. **Trigger a new build**:
   ```bash
   git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger build after backend deployment"
   git push
   ```

2. **Or manually trigger in Amplify Console**:
   ```bash
   aws amplify start-job --app-id d32q73w0m2w4bq --branch-name main --job-type RELEASE --region eu-north-1
   ```

## Expected Result

After backend deployment, the Amplify build will:
- ✅ Find the CloudFormation stack
- ✅ Generate amplify_outputs.json
- ✅ Build the Next.js app
- ✅ Deploy to Amplify Hosting
- ✅ App will be live!

## Troubleshooting

If builds still fail after backend deployment:
1. Check that the stack exists:
   ```bash
   aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name amplify-d32q73w0m2w4bq-main-branch-c8c420b81a --region eu-north-1
   ```

2. Check Amplify build logs for specific errors

3. Ensure Node 20 is being used (already configured in amplify.yml)

## Why This Happens

The Amplify build process needs:
1. Backend resources to exist (CloudFormation stack)
2. To generate amplify_outputs.json from those resources
3. This config file for the frontend to connect to backend

The CI/CD pipeline can't create the initial backend - it can only update it once it exists.
